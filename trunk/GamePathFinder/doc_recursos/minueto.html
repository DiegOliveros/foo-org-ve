      <h2>
         1. Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
         Java provides two frameworks for designing graphical user
         interfaces: AWT and Swing. Although these frameworks are
         ideal for data manipulation, they render much too slowly
         to be used in game development. The following article
         presents the core knowledge required to develop fast 2D
         games in Java without using Swing or AWT. This article
         also describes the mistakes commonly made by beginner Java
         2D programmers that can easily degrade display
         performance. These lessons we learned while developing
         Minueto[<a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a>], a
         game development tool for McGill undergraduate students.
      </p>
      <h3>
         1.1 Basic Building Blocks
      </h3>
      <p>
         There are 2 basic building blocks for graphics in a 2D
         game, a <em>drawing canvas</em> and a collection of
         <em>images</em>. The canvas can either be displayed on the
         screen as a window, or encompass the entire screen. Images
         are the building blocks that get drawn on the canvas. They
         are drawn repetitively on the screen to produce animation.
      </p>
      <p>
         In Java, the canvas is either a <strong>Frame</strong> or
         a <strong>JFrame</strong> object. The images are stored in
         <strong>BufferedImage</strong> objects. Images can be
         drawn on the canvas or over other images through the use
         of a <strong>Graphics2D</strong> object. The following
         sections explain how to properly build your canvas
         (section 2) and your images (section 3).
      </p>
      <h2>
         2. The Canvas
      </h2>
      <p>
         As previously mentioned, the drawing canvas should be a
         simple JFrame. To insure flicker free performance, the
         "ignore repaint" property should be enabled
         (using the <strong>setIgnoreRepaint</strong> method). This
         prevents the Java virtual machine (JVM) from trying to
         modify the content of the canvas.
      </p>
      <h3>
         2.1 Graphic Device and Configuration
      </h3>
      <p>
         The <strong>GraphicsDevice</strong> class is used to
         describe graphic output devices, such are your
         computer's graphic card. It contains a collection of
         <strong>GraphicsConfiguration</strong> objects that
         describe all the possible configurations for the graphic
         card, i.e. all the supported resolutions and color modes.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>
            <code>// Acquiring the current Graphics Device and
            Graphics Configuration<br>
            GraphicsEnvironment graphEnv =
            GraphicsEnvironment.getLocalGraphicsEnvironment();<br>

            GraphicsDevice graphDevice =
            graphEnv.getDefaultScreenDevice();<br>
            GraphicsConfiguration graphicConf =
            graphDevice.getDefaultConfiguration();<br></code>
         </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
         When creating a new JFrame, we highly suggest passing the
         current graphic configuration constructor as a parameter.
         This allows the JFrame to be specially constructed for
         that graphic configuration and avoids common color mode
         problems (as described in section 3.3).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>
            <code>//Creating the JFrame<br>
            JFrame jFrame = new JFrame(graphicConf);<br>
            jFrame.setIgnoreRepaint(true);<br>
            jFrame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);<br>

            jFrame.setTitle("Minueto");<br>
            jFrame.setFocusTraversalKeysEnabled(false);<br></code>
         </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
         In addition, the current graphic configuration is needed
         to produce hardware accelerated images (as described in
         section 3.4).
      </p>
      <h3>
         2.2 Proper Size for a Window
      </h3>
      <p>
         Creating a drawing surface of a specific size can be
         tricky with a normal windowed frame. A 640 by 480 pixels
         JFrame will have a drawing surface of approximately 630 by
         440 pixels (see figure 1). This loss of space can be
         explained by the title bar and the window borders which
         are include in the original size of 640 by 480 pixels
         [<a href="#ref6">6</a>].
      </p>
      <p>
         An easy solution to this problem is to insert a 640x480
         <strong>Canvas</strong> object (with ignore repaint set to
         true) inside the JFrame. This will force the JFrame to
         contain a true 640 by 480 drawing surface, regardless of
         the size of the title bar or windows border. Note that
         this solution requires all drawing to be done on the
         Canvas, instead of the JFrame. We found that this solution
         is practical and has no impact on performance.

         640x480 drawing area.
      </p>
      <p>
         Note: This problem does not exist for full screen windows
         or border-less windows, as they don't have borders or
         title bars to reduce the size of the drawing area.
      </p>
      <h3>
         2.3 Fullscreen Window and Changing the Resolution
      </h3>
      <p>
         The GraphicsDevice object can also be used to change the
         resolution of the screen or transform a frame so it covers
         the whole screen (full screen mode). We found that
         resolution changes using a pre-1.5 JVM are dangerous and
         could cause the process to crash [<a href="#ref6">6</a>].
         In addition, resolution changes are not supported with a
         pre-1.4 JVM under Linux.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>
            <code>//Switching Resolution and to Full Screen<br>
            DisplayMode disMode = new DisplayMode( width, height,
            32, DisplayMode.REFRESH_RATE_UNKNOWN);<br>
            graphDevice.setFullScreenWindow(jFrame);<br>
            graphDevice.setDisplayMode(disMode);<br></code>
         </p>

      <h3>
         2.4 Double Buffering
      </h3>
      <p>
         The key to smooth animation in Java is to use double
         buffering. Double buffering is a technique where a
         <strong>memory buffer</strong> is created as a workspace
         for changes to appear on the screen. The content of this
         buffer is displayed on screen only once all the changes to
         the current frame have been completed (see figure 2). This
         avoids flickering and other graphic artifacts commonly
         produced by the progressive updating of the screen. Double
         buffering also allows the synchronization of the screen
         updates with the refresh rate of the monitor.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;">

 height="300" width="600"><br>
         Figure 2 : Double Buffering.
      </p>
      <p>
         In Java, double buffering is provided by the
         <strong>BufferStrategy</strong> class. Although
         BufferStrategy allows for n-buffering, we found that
         double-buffering (that is, creating a BufferStrategy with
         2 buffers) was optimal.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>
            <code>//Setting up Double Buffering<br>
            jFrame.createBufferStrategy(2);<br>
            BufferStrategy bufferStrategy =
            jFrame.getBufferStrategy();<br>
            Graphics2D graph2D =
            (Graphics2D)bufferStrategy.getDrawGraphics();<br></code>
         </p>

      <h2>
         3. Buffered Images
      </h2>
      <p>
         Chet Haase, an engineer on the Java 2D team, documented no
         less than 38 different methods to create an image with the
         Java 1.4 API [<a href="#ref2">2</a>]. These different
         methods produce images with various characteristics. We
         found that the optimal methods for producing efficient
         BufferedImage object were found in the
         GraphicsConfiguration object [<a href="#ref3">3</a>] used
         to create the JFrame (as describe in the section 2.1).
         They assure greatest compatibility between the images and
         the drawing canvas.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>
            <code>// Creating a hardware accelerated image with
            bitmask transparencies.<br>
            BufferedImage imageBitMask =
            graphicConf.createCompatibleImage(x,y,
            Transparency.BITMASK);<br></code>
         </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
         <br>
      </p>
      <h3>
         3.1 Volatile Images vs. Managed Images
      </h3>
      <p>
         Two types of images in Java are hardware accelerated:
         volatile images and managed images. Volatile images are
         stored only in video memory and are extremely fast.
         However, if the video memory is overwritten by another
         application, the content is lost. Managed images are
         stored in both video memory and conventional memory, thus
         do not suffer from the "content lost" problem.
         Although this redundancy incurs a performance cost, we
         found manually managing volatile images would be too much
         overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
         Certain operations that can be applied to a BufferedImage
         object, such as manipulating the image at the pixel level,
         can make an object lose it's hardware accelerated
         features. When this occurs, the image is no longer stored
         in video memory. To make it regain its hardware
         acceleration, a manipulated image should be copied to a
         new accelerated BufferedImage before it is used.
      </p>
      <h3>
         3.2 Color Mode
      </h3>
      <p>
         The key to successful image acceleration is to create an
         image with the same characteristics as the current
         display. For example, if the current display is switched
         to RBGA 32-bit color mode, then all images should be
         created, loaded and/or converted to this color mode. To
         this extent, we copy every loaded image into a new
         accelerated BufferedImage, which automatically has the
         correct color mode.
      </p>
      <p>
         If this is not done and images are loaded and stored using
         different color modes, those images need to be converted
         to the screen's color mode every time they are drawn
         to the canvas, causing tremendous slowdowns.
      </p>
      <h3>
         3.3 Transparencies
      </h3>
      <p>
         Java supports three type of transparencies: opaque (no
         transparencies), bitmask (a pixel is either transparent or
         not) and alpha (variable level of transparency for each
         pixel). We found the use of either opaque or bitmask
         transparencies produces impressive performance, even on
         modest graphic hardware. Alpha transparencies are much
         slower, especially when using graphic cards that do not
         provide hardware support for aplpha transparencies. We
         therefore recommend avoiding alpha transparencies, unless
         they are specifically needed.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>
            <code>// Creating a hardware accelerated image with
            bitmask alpha.<br>
            BufferedImage imageAlpha =
            graphicConf.createCompatibleImage(x,y,
            Transparency.TRANSLUCENT);<br></code>
         </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
         <br>
      </p>
      <h3>
         3.4 Rendering to the screen
      </h3>
      <p>
         As previously mentioned in section 2.4, images should
         first be drawn on the memory buffer.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>
            <code>//Drawing an image on the memory buffer<br>
            graph2D.drawImage(bufferedImage, x, y,
            null);<br></code>
         </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
         Once the frame is ready, we can render the content of the
         memory buffer to the screen.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>
            <code>// Rendering the current buffer to screen<br>
            graph2D.dispose();<br>
            bufferStrategy.show();<br>

         5. Conclusion and Future Work
      </h2>
      <p>
         Despite our initial apprehension about using Java for game
         development, Java 2D has shown to be very efficient, if
         used properly. Two years of using Minueto for the game
         development of COMP-361 projects, the Systems Development
         Project course at McGill, has shown that it performs
         extremely well, thanks to the different optimizations
         presented in this article. Our future work in this area
         will focus on efficient ways to combine Swing and Java 2D
         technology.
